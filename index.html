    <h1>Fluid Space</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">Space is precious. The optimal use of space on the web involves taking care of content, design and legibility. By using the principles from Utopia, space is created and preserved without having to worry about breakpoints. Trusting the ebb and flow of the internet to find the best solutions. </p>

        <h2>Scaling fluidity</h2>
        <p>As a starting point for fluid space, Utopia has calculated different spacial values which scales within its own size based on a multiplier value. At different device sizes they will transition both within its own size, and relative to other sizes. This ensures that different "feelings" of sizing is preserved</p>
        <p class="resize">Resize the browser window to observe the transition.</p>
        <div class="units">
            <ul class="units-grid">
                <li class="unit1"></li>
                <li class="unit2"></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>These sizes can be customized and used in any way needed to support the content, for example by using <code>clamp()</code>. They can also be used for different white spaces like <code>gap:</code>. This gives flexibility and variation, and challenges designers and developers to maximize the contents potential.</p>

    <section class="grid-scale">
        <h2>Grid</h2>
        <p>The same principles can also be used when setting the specifics of a Grid structure. What is being calculated is the width of the main container, the gaps, and a number of columns. Be aware that the columns calculated is not definite, and can be customized for each grid, as you see underneath with one grid of six columns and one of four. </p>
        <p class="resize">Resize the browser window to observe the transition.</p>
        <div class="grid-container">
            <ul class="grid1">
                <li>Column 1</li>
                <li>Column 2</li>
                <li>Column 3</li>
                <li>Column 4</li>
                <li>Column 5</li>
                <li>Column 6</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="grid2">
                <li>Column 1</li>
                <li>Column 2</li>
                <li>Column 3</li>
                <li>Column 4</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>For all practical purposes what is being fluidly transitioned is the container and the gaps. If your content needs a set amount of equal sized columns, then relying on the column calculations are useful. If the content needs more flexibility, these calculations are a good starting point for a container.

        <h2>Design and development</h2>
        <p>Space, grids, flex boxes, white space, layout ...</p>
        <p>Where to start?</p>
        <p>The best use of space and layouts on the web is a never-ending discussion, and one that will never be finished or "won". The reason being it all comes down to the content and the desired user experience.</p>
        <p>But the tools in HTML and CSS is much better than earlier, and with the Utopia calculations for fluid space transitions, content and "the feel" of the web can be front and center, instead of endless discussion about pixel perfection, breakingpoints, media queries and other limitations.</p>
